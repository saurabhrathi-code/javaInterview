Q1. What is polymorphism. method overloading and method overriding.
Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming. Poly means Many and morphism means forms.
There are two type: 
Compile Time(method overloading) and runtime(method overriding) polymorphism.

Method Overloading: If a class has multiple methods having same name but different parameters its known as method overloading. The compiler determines which method to call based on method signature. 
eg. public class Calculator { 
      public int add(int a, int b) {
	     return a+b;
    }
	
	public double add(double a, double b) { 
	     return a+b;
	}
}	

Method Overriding: If Child class(subclass) has a same method as declared in the parent class(super class), it is known as method overriding. It allows child class to provide a specialized version of a method defined in its parent class.
eg. public class Animal {
       public void makeSound() {
	      System.out.println("Generic animal sound");
	   }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {

    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
	   System.out.println("woof! woof!")
	}
}
