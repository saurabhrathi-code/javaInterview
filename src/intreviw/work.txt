Throughout sprints, I have been involved in understanding and implementing various technologies like newRelic, PagerDuty to create dashboards so as to facilitate early identification and resolution of various bugs. These tasks have been carried out as an effort to continuously automate repetitive work so as to improve performance. This work has been done in addition to the API development activities that are assigned during sprints.

Recently, I have automated the task of creating API documentation using Cucumber. This is a BDD-driven development methodology that also bridges the gaps in API understanding between the development and the client teams.
